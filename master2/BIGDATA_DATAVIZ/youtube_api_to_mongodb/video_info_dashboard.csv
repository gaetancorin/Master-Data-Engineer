1:07:41 Talk #2: Deep Dive into Apache Beam
By Tyler Akidau and Reuven Lax, Google

Abstract: In this talk, Tyler will describe the architecture of Apache Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow, a well-designed, high-performance streaming engine.

Apache Beam is the set of open source SDKs for writing pipelines, and you can then run these Beam pipelines on any platform with a supported Runner (currently: Apache Apex, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow). 

Cloud Dataflow is Google's closed-source execution engine provided as a managed service on Google Cloud for running Beam pipelines.

The goal of this talk is to understand the unique patterns, design choices, and trade-offs that make Apache Beam and Cloud Dataflow compelling options.

BaT5DXDIGVI,Frontiers in Machine Learning: Accelerating Machine Learning with Confidential Computing,2020-07-28 20:00:14+00:00,UCCb9_Kn8F_Opb3UCGm-lILQ,"In the recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has facilitated key applications, such as medical imaging, video analytics, and financial forecasting. Understanding the massive computing requirements of ML, cloud providers have been investing in accelerated ML computing and a range of ML services. A key concern in such systems, however, is the privacy of the sensitive data being analyzed and the confidentiality of the trained models. Confidential cloud computing provides a vehicle for privacy-preserving ML, enabling multiple entities to collaborate and train accurate models using sensitive data, and to serve these models with assurance that their data and models remain protected, even from privileged attackers. In this session, our speakers will demonstrate applications and advancements in Confidential ML: (i) how confidential computing hardware can accelerate multi-party and collaborative training, creating an incentive for data sharing; and (ii) how emerging cloud accelerator systems can be re-designed to deliver strong privacy guarantees, overcoming the limited performance of CPU-based confidential computing.

----------------------------------------
# Abstract:

The rise of real-time data processing has transformed business operations, yet navigating its technical challenges remains complex. Organizations often wrestle with managing distinct batch and streaming data workflows, each presenting unique difficulties. Batch processing, while effective for large datasets, can be costly, slow, and not well-suited for streaming API integration. On the other hand, streaming, despite its speed and low latency, often has restricted functionality.

This talk is prepared for developers, data engineers, and tech visionaries eager to explore how to build an efficient, dynamic, and unified data pipeline for both scenarios using streaming platforms in Python. You will see with examples how simple it is to make your batch code run in streaming with serverless infrastructure from day 1.

Excerpt from OReilly's Book on MLOps.
 
"" ML Ops originated as a derivative of applying DevOps practices to data science and machine learning workflows or pipelines. The term combines ML (machine learning) and operations (Ops). At its core, it represents a repeatable process to deploy, monitor, and maintain these pipelines in operational or production systems. 

Companies that build this kind of methodical thinking into their data science have a big competitive advantage over those that consistently fail to operationalize models and that fail to prioritize action over mere insight ""

Excerpt from OReilly's Book on MLOps.
 
"" ML Ops originated as a derivative of applying DevOps practices to data science and machine learning workflows or pipelines. The term combines ML (machine learning) and operations (Ops). At its core, it represents a repeatable process to deploy, monitor, and maintain these pipelines in operational or production systems. 

Companies that build this kind of methodical thinking into their data science have a big competitive advantage over those that consistently fail to operationalize models and that fail to prioritize action over mere insight ""

Die Erstellung eines Modells für maschinelles Lernen ist nur ein Ausgangspunkt. Um es in die Produktion zu bringen, müssen Sie verschiedene reale Probleme lösen, wie z. B. den Aufbau einer Pipeline für kontinuierliches Modelltraining, die Automatisierung der Validierung der Modelle, die Schaffung einer Serving-Infrastruktur, die Implementierung der Überwachung und vieles mehr.
Um diese Herausforderungen zu meistern, gibt es verschiedene Lösungen auf dem Markt, wie z.B. Kubeflow, Databricks MLFlow, usw.

In dieser Session zeigt Sascha Dittmann, wie diese Lösungen für Ihre KI-Projekte von Nutzen sein können und wie Sie diese in Ihre tägliche Arbeit integrieren können.
Sie werden auch die Konzepte von ""MLOps"" (DevOps für Machine Learning) kennenlernen.

Sascha Dittmann ist Cloud Solution Architect bei der Microsoft Deutschland GmbH und unterstützt hierbei Kunden und Partner beim Implementierungsprozess erfolgreicher Cloud-Lösungen. Seine Schwerpunkte liegen in der Softwareentwicklung für die Microsoft Azure Plattform, sowie im SQL Server Business Intelligence, Big Data und Machine Learning Bereich.
Bevor er Ende 2015 zu Microsoft kam, war er viele Jahre bei der heutigen Ernst & Young GmbH tätig; Davon 13 Jahre als Softwareentwickler und 3 Jahre als Solution Architect. Während dieser Zeit gründete er auch die Community-Webseite cloudbloggers.de und war Mitbegründer des .NET Stammtischs Rheinhessen und der Xamarin User Group Frankfurt. Zwischen 2012 und 2015 wurde er 4-mal von Microsoft mit dem ""Microsoft Most Valuable Professional""-Award für seine Arbeit im Microsoft-Azure-Umfeld ausgezeichnet.

In the talk we'll give a brief overview of different aspects of Cyber Security in the modern world, talking about Cloud and other external services that any size of a company uses nowadays. We'll show from experience that the best and most fit approach is to achieve ongoing monitoring on your security posture. For the ""why""? because the only thing that is 100% sure, that the attack surface of every company is changing constantly, so we should keep on validating our security posture accordingly. And now the ""How"": We'll share how to build an infrastructure for security researchers that will allow them to concentrate on business logic and writing hacker “tasks”. Using Docker and Kubernetes on Google Cloud, these tasks can then be performed in parallel and without a lot of DevOps hassle. Our technique removes two common barriers: first, long and risky deployment processes and second, low transparency within the production system.

Today, corporate data landscapes are growing increasingly diverse and distributed. Data volume is exploding with unstructured data from the Internet of Things and social media. And many companies are storing data in multiple locations – on premise, in the cloud, in data warehouses, and on edge devices. A Data orchestration solution can help you unlock this treasure trove. It can help to create powerful, scalable data pipelines that connect data sources – without moving the data.
But what are the current challenges? The session intends to deal with the below

* The challenges in operating and maintaining a data orchestration solution running on kubernetes
* Learn how Data orchestration done natively on Kubernetes marks a milestone in simplifying landscape requirements and the installation process for customers.
* Learn how having a fully containerized architecture enables deployments on any platform that supports Kubernetes.
* Learn how cloud scale workloads can be handled by enterprise grade data orchestration solution
* Learn about day to day housekeeping to manage kube-system, helm, prometheus, and rook.

Intro/Outro Music: Thanks to Gerhard Herselman for supplying the music for us to use. 

At Nomanini we built our first payments platform on Google Cloud when it was still only App Engine. As our product grew we built an ever-more-complex monolith. As our start-up pivoted we needed more flexibility, and wanted to experiment with newer technologies. With only three developers we made the bold decision to migrate our platform from an App Engine monolith to microservices running on Docker and Kubernetes. In this frank discussion I talk about the reasons why we made this move, the pitfalls we experienced, the benefits of the move, and why we love Kubernetes on Google Cloud.

A few of the issues end users may face include memory and scalability limitations of these tools and the exorbitant costs associated with transferring large amounts of data between different platforms. 

In this session, we will introduce Procedural Language R (PL/R) as a closer integration of R with the Greenplum Database, an open source massively parallel processing (MPP) engine for big data analytics. While the focus of this talk will be on PL/R, the same principles described in the session are applicable to all languages supported by the Procedural Language extension framework (e.g. R, Python, Java, C, Perl) of the Greenplum Database.

We will describe how to get started on PL/R, and walk through code examples from case studies in industries such as retail, telco and utilities that illustrate the flexibility and performance of this framework. Further, we will touch on how tools such as PL/R can be leveraged for scalable statistical and machine learning algorithm development on big data platforms using Bayesian Hierarchical Regression with Gibbs Sampling as an illustrative example.

IKThPZQfBlM,Integrating Open Source Alluxio in AWS EKS with Terraform,2021-04-01 22:06:47+00:00,UCpibQsajhwqYPLYhke4RigA,"Alluxio is an open source Data orchestration platform that can be deployed on multiple platforms. However, it can require a lot of thinking and experience to integrate Alluxio into an existing Data Architecture adhering to minimally required DevOps principles meeting Organizational standards. 

The presentation talks about the best practices to set up and techniques to build a cluster with open source Alluxio on AWS EKS, for one of our clients, which made it Scalable, Reliable, and Secure by adapting to Kubernetes RBAC.

Our speaker Vasista Polali will show you how to :  
- Bootstrap EKS cluster in AWS with Terraform.  
- Deploy open source Alluxio in a Namespace with persistence in AWS EFS.  
- Scale up and down the Alluxio worker nodes as Daemon sets by Scaling the EKS nodes with Terraform.  
- Accessing data with S3 mount.  
- Controlling the access to Alluxio with Kubernetes port-forwarding, “setfacl” functionality, and Kubernetes service accounts.  
- Re-using the data/metadata in the persistence layer on a new cluster.",202,1,0,0.0,,,2021,04,April,0-1K

// Intro to Kubeflow
As the involvement of Machine Learning components in software products is increasing rapidly, there is a growing need for tools to operate and orchestrate Machine Learning development and deployment. One of those tools is Kubeflow. Developed by Google for the Open Source community, this tool aims to organize the cycle of model development, testing, and deployment on the infrastructure of Kubernetes. In this talk, we will introduce the tool, its capabilities, and its integration in the infrastructure of organizations.

// Simplifying and extending Kubeflow with serverless ML functions

Serverless can simplify data science by automating the process of code to container and enables users to add instrumentation and auto-scaling with minimum overhead. However, serverless has many limitations involving performance, lack of concurrency, lack of GPU support, limited application patterns and limited debugging possibilities. Yaron Haviv will introduce Kubeflow, and how it works with Nuclio and MLRun, open source projects enabling serverless data-science and full ML lifecycle automation over Kubeflow.

Yaron will show real-world examples and a demo and explain how it can significantly accelerate projects time to market and save resources.",291,4,0,1.0,,,2020,07,July,0-1K

Summary
- For web deployment, you need to be familiar with the concept of REST API.
- You can deploy the code to Virtual Machines, and then scale by adding instances.
- You can deploy the code as containers, and then scale via orchestration.
- You can deploy the code as a “server-less function.”
- You can deploy the code via a model serving solution.
- If you are making CPU inference, you can get away with scaling by launching more servers (Docker), or going serverless (AWS Lambda).
- If you are using GPU inference, things like TF Serving and Clipper become useful with features such as adaptive batching.",2682,16,0,1.0,ml,en,2020,07,July,1K-10K

ZQx-9gYfzzA,Armada   Building a research platform on top of Openstack and Kubernetes,2023-06-29 16:39:40+00:00,UCQ74G2gKXdpwZkXEsclzcrA,"Quantitative researchers require a lot of hardware.  The major goals of our research platform are to enable high-throughput scheduling of jobs, use open source software and to provide queueing capabilities once the number of jobs exceeds capacity.  We use Openstack for our hardware provisioning.  However, provisioning hardware is only the first step in building a research platform.  In this talk we will discuss how you can build a research platform on top of OpenStack and Kubernetes to better enable quantitative researchers to run their workflows.  The types of workflows we have to support range from analytics to machine learning.   

Armada is an open source project developed at G-Research.  Armada enables researchers to submit thousands of jobs to a multi cluster Kubernetes compute platform and these jobs get prioritized.

- **What is a container?**: You can Abstract containers as lightweight virtual machines with their own CPU, Memory and Network Resources
- software that packages up code and all its dependencies
- so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
- **Docker Image:** To start a container you need a docker image, this image is your blueprint for the container, you can get prebuilt images like MySQ
- **Dockerfile:** A yaml based instructions for building the image. You can consider it like DNA to the image with all the set of instructions in a place to make the image.
- **Dockerhub**: Cloud based GitHub for your Docker images; Building and hosting images for sharing across
