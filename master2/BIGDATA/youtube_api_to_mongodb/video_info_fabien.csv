Though machine learning and AI are immensely powerful, these solutions are by no means easy. In many cases, there are many diverse components that are not designed to work together. Additionally, these models are most efficient when running on large scale clusters that can be more difficult to manage. Configuration and deployment is often left to data scientists who are wasting time on infrastructure and not on data science itself.Kubernetes to the rescue! In this session I will talk about how machine learning can be greatly improved by implementing ML solutions on top of Kubernetes with containers. I will be discussing each stage of a typical workflow including: data preparation/versioning, model training, testing and validation, monitoring, and CI/CD and automation. Demos will include tooling such as Tensorflow/Kubeflow, Pachyderm, Argo, etc.This talk is for both data scientists and infrastructure/SRE teams alike helping bring the benefits of DevOps to AI and machine learning.",1789,34,0,N/A,,N/A

Docker is the most popular container environment and kubernetes platform for orchestrating containers. There are 3 major areas where Docker and Kubernetes can help accelerate data science initiatives

1.Infrastructure 
2.Tooling and Reproducible
3.Deployment and Scaling

Benefits for Data Science project include

- Efficient usage of infrastructure
- Bring in parity between development and production
- Manage multiple versions of tools efficiently
- Seamless scaling to meet business demand
- Ease of migration of models to production

We present the evolution of a model to a production API that can scale to large e-commerce needs. On the journey we discuss metrics of success and how to use the Kubernetes cluster manager and associated tools for deploy. In addition to the use of these tools we highlight how to make use of the cluster management system for further testing and experimentation with your models.

The chasm between data science and dev ops is often wide and impenetrable, but the two fields have more in common than meets the eye. Every data scientist will be able to lean in and help their career by investing in a basic understanding the basic principles of dev ops. In this talk I present the notions of service level indicators, objectives, and agreements. I cover the rigorous monitoring and testing of services. Finally we demonstrate how to build a basic data science workflow and push to production level APIs with Docker and Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is an opinionated container cluster manager with an easy to use, robust interface. It can be use on very small and very large clusters. Docker is a container system that allows one to build code in an isolated environment. Paired with a container manager such as Kubernetes we are able to manage millions of instances as needed for a production deployment. These tools are two of many different options but are considered among the best open source solutions available. 00:00 Welcome!

Abstract: Docker has become a standard tool for developers around the world to deploy applications in a reproducible and robust manner. The existence of Docker and Docker compose have reduced the time needed to set up new software and implementing complex technology stacks for our applications.

Now, six years after the initial release of Docker, we can say with confidence that containers and containers orchestration have become some of the defaults in the current technology stacks.

There are thousands of tutorials and getting started documents for those wanting to adopt Docker for apps deployment. However, if you are a Data Scientist, a researcher or someone working on scientific computing wanting to adopt Docker, the story is quite different. There are very few tutorials (in comparison to app/web) and documents focused on Docker best practices for DS and scientific computing. If you are working on DS, ML or scientific computing, this talk is for you. We'll cover best practices when building Docker containers for data-intensive applications, from optimising your image build, to ensuring your containers are secure and efficient deployment workflows. We will talk about the most common problems faced while using Docker with data-intensive applications and how you can overcome most of them. Finally, I'll give some practical and useful tips for you to improve your Docker workflows and practises.

Attendees will leave the talk feeling confident about adopting Docker across a range of DS, ML and research projects.",55,N/A,0,0,"all things open, open source, ato2020, technology, Big Data, Tania Allard PhD, Microsoft, docker, Data Scientist",N/A

Managing Machine Learning in Production with Kubeflow and DevOps - David Aronchick, Microsoft  

Kubeflow has helped bring machine learning to Kubernetes, but there’s still a significant gap relative to how to productize these workloads. While DevOps and GitOps have made huge traction in recent years, many customers struggle to apply these practices to ML workloads. 

This talk will focus on ways to effectively infuse AI into production-grade applications through establishing practices around model reproducibility, validation, versioning/tracking, and safe/compliant deployment. 

We will demonstrate how to run an E2E machine learning system using nothing more than Git. This will integrate DevOps, data and ML pipelines together, and show how to use multiple workload orchestrators together. 

While the examples will be run using Azure Pipelines and Kubeflow, we will also show how to extend these platforms to any orchestration tool.

When I was asked to deploy containers to Kubernetes at a new job, I was confident I could learn it quickly. 

Well, I was wrong.

Kubernetes is complex, mainly because there are underlying skills that developers do not possess which makes it confusing. 

So it's vital to first learn these concepts, and only then Kubernetes will make sense. 

In this video, I'll teach you what those 5 concepts are.

 You've created and tuned a machine learning model, using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn - now what? How can you ensure that the model is deployed to your DevOps team as production-ready code, and can scale as needed on incoming data? How can you seamlessly migrate a model from your local laptop / virtual machine to a hosted server on your cloud platform of choice? 
 
 This talk walks through the architecture of Kubeflow: a project dedicated to answering those questions - and to making machine learning on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. 
 
 We will describe, in detail, the three components of the project:
 
 * a JupyterHub platform for creating and managing Jupyter notebook servers that are used by data science and research groups;
 
 * a Tensorflow Customer Resource for managing compute resources to a specific cluster size; and 
 
 * a Tensorflow Serving container to house the machine learning work.
 
 By the end of this talk, you will have a firm understanding of why Kubernetes would be useful to machine learning engineers, and how you can deploy it, today, to support your predictive models.

Containers are a game-changing tool for app development and deployment, offering isolated, portable environments that include code, libraries, and OS. Unlike virtual machines (VMs), containers are lightweight and share the host system's kernel, making them faster and more resource-efficient.

Developers benefit from containers as they allow working in multiple environments simultaneously without compromising the local machine. This ensures compatibility across different machines and platforms, eliminating the ""it works on my machine"" issue.

Docker is a popular container platform that uses overlapping layers to form container images. These images can be extended from any previous image or layer, with numerous pre-made base images available for various requirements.

Using a Dockerfile, developers can add commands to generate new file system layers or metadata layers. Multiple containers can run from a single image, with each container having its dedicated file system layer that persists until the container is deleted.

Containers can communicate easily, and when an app is ready for deployment, it can be tagged with a unique version and published to a container registry. Modern cloud platforms offer built-in support for deploying containers, or you can install a compatible container runtime on your machine for more control. 

Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes enable the creation of container-based clouds, providing even greater flexibility and control in app development and deployment.

---

In the video, I cover:
- Understand containers and their benefits for developers
- Compare VMs and containers, and their resource usage
- Maintain multiple environments with containers to avoid conflicts
- Solve the ""it works on my machine"" problem with container consistency
- Explore container images, Dockerfiles, and overlapping layers
- Use pre-made and officially supported base images for projects
- Create and run containers using Docker as a container platform
- Communicate between containers through virtualized network layers
- Tag and publish container images to registries for storage
- Deploy containers using cloud platforms or compatible runtimes
- Utilize container orchestration with Kubernetes for advanced deployments

---

Additions:

Despite me presenting it as so, containers don't contain a true OS in the full meaning of the word. That's an oversimplification. It's more of an ""OS-like"" environment. It definitely can act in ways that you'd expect an OS to act, but there are some differences.

If you use VSCode, check out ""Dev Containers"" - they are an awesome way to integrate your IDE into dedicated containerized development environments with just a single click.

Sharing a Kernel with the host does come with some potential drawbacks. Most importantly is that containers would be more vulnerable to attack than VMs should the host machine be compromised. However, containers are heavily used in many large-scale production environments and security can be hardened against such attacks, so it's definitely not a bigger concern than keeping software secure in general.

wytCjR-qdpI,Infrastructure Agnostic Machine Learning Workload Deployment,2021-07-12T17:48:04Z,UC3q8O3Bh2Le8Rj1-Q-_UUbA,"When it comes to Large Scale data processing and Machine Learning, Apache Spark is no doubt one of the top battle-tested frameworks out there for handling batched or streaming workloads.  The ease of use, built-in Machine Learning modules, and multi-language support makes it a very attractive choice for data wonks. However bootstrapping and getting off the ground could be difficult for most teams without leveraging a Spark cluster that is already pre-provisioned and provided as a managed service in the Cloud, while this is a very attractive choice to get going, in the long run, it could be a very expensive option if it’s not well managed.

As an alternative to this approach, our team has been exploring and working a lot with running Spark and all our Machine Learning workloads and pipelines as containerized Docker packages on Kubernetes. This provides an infrastructure-agnostic abstraction layer for us, and as a result, it improves our operational efficiency and reduces our overall compute cost. Most importantly, we can easily target our Spark workload deployment to run on any major Cloud or On-prem infrastructure (with Kubernetes as the common denominator)  by just modifying a few configurations.

In this talk, we will walk you through the process our team follows to make it easy for us to run a production deployment of our Machine Learning workloads and pipelines on Kubernetes which seamlessly allows us to port our implementation from a local Kubernetes set up on the laptop during development to either an On-prem or Cloud Kubernetes environment.

A major financial institute supports its analytic workload via docker containers with access to R, Python, and SAS. This talk discusses how we built and deployed containers with the open source tools needed for their Data Scientists to complete their work. It discusses how containers enable their IT department to meet the ad hoc, compute intensive, and scaling demands of the organization. It also covers how provisioning thin clients via Jupyter Notebooks, R Studio, and SAS Studio, empowers Data Scientists with the tool of their choice. An exciting differentiator for the Data Scientist, is the ability to send a portion of the analytic workload to run inside their Hadoop cluster. Lastly, we discuss extending the container by pushing the analytic workload to run inside the Hadoop cluster; thus enabling the Data Scientists to dive inside the data lake and harness the power of all the data.

Great strides have been made within the open source communities towards running big data workloads in containers, but much is left to be done.

Apache Hadoop YARN is the modern distributed operating system for big data applications. It has morphed the Hadoop compute layer into a common resource-management platform that can host a wide variety of applications. At its core, YARN has a very powerful scheduler which enforces global cluster level invariants and helps sites manage user and operator expectations of elastic sharing, resource usage limits, SLAs, and more. YARN recently increased its support for Docker containerization and added a YARN service framework supporting long-running services.

In this session we will explore the emerging patterns and challenges related to containers and big data workloads, including running applications such as Apache Spark, Apache HBase, and Kubernetes in containers on YARN.

Unfortunately, as enterprises now try to use big data with machine learning, data science tends to get left behind. Challenges that engineers and data scientists face when developing an ML-based system are reliably deploying models, managing ML assets at scale, and knowing when models are going stale. Introducing a DevOps approach to Machine learning helps solve these challenges by providing structure for collaborating and bringing models into production.  This talk covers real improvements that MLOps has brought to large enterprise customers in maintaining asset integrity across teams, accelerating model operationalization, and enabling a sophisticated AI application lifecycle. We share pointers on how you can follow the same journey in your org.

Several cases involve a combination of domain specific models such as physics based models, probabilistic models and AI/ML models. In many cases, each of these models could be written in a different programming language and/or with several different libraries within the same programming language. This necessitates the need for containerized and orchestrated workloads. In some cases, different parts of the pipeline could be owned by different groups that may not want to expose the IP. 
In addition, model calibration and optimization use cases require more than a simple DAG orchestration. In many of these cases, cyclic and conditional workflows are needed.  When dealing with Industrial IoT applications, hundreds if not thousands of models are normally built to represent a single asset. In addition, optimization and calibration use cases require executing the pipelines thousands of times for each optimization or calibration exercise. Hence scaling such complex pipelines is a key component of industrial analytics systems. We will showcase building and managing such complex pipelines using various GCP services such as GKE, TFX, PubSub and BigTable.

These two really popular fields are not often combined, but there are some fantastic opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas. Damian, Paige and Terry discuss what's important to data scientists and where to start when it comes to a DevOps process. From using source control, testing and refreshing predictive models to operationalizing and evaluating success in production.

Data scientists are rarely developers, and developers are rarely data scientists, but they can work together, using tools and techniques that still allow the experts to do what they do best!

x4oIdooDzKo,Machine Learning Models in Production,2018-05-16T21:02:50Z,UC5o4P1O-WVE15EZWqayc5dw,"Data Scientists and Machine Learning practitioners, nowadays, seem to be churning out models by the dozen and they continuously experiment to find ways to improve their accuracies. They also use a variety of ML and DL frameworks & languages , and a typical organization may find that this results in a heterogenous, complicated bunch of assets that require different types of runtimes, resources and sometimes even specialized compute to operate efficiently.

But what does it mean for an enterprise to actually take these models to ""production"" ? How does an organization scale inference engines out & make them available for real-time applications without significant latencies ? There needs to be different techniques for batch ,offline, inferences and instant, online scoring. Data needs to be accessed from various sources and cleansing, transformations of data needs to be enabled prior to any predictions. In many cases, there maybe no substitute for customized data handling with scripting either.

Enterprises also require additional auditing and authorizations built in, approval processes and still support a ""continuous delivery"" paradigm whereby a data scientist can enable insights faster. Not all models are created equal, nor are consumers of a model - so enterprises require both metering and allocation of compute resources for SLAs.

In this session, we will take a look at how machine learning is operationalized in IBM Data Science Experience, DSX, a Kubernetes based offering for the Private Cloud and optimized for the HortonWorks Hadoop Data Platform. DSX essentially brings in typical software engineering development practices to Data Science, organizing the dev-test-production for machine learning assets in much the same way as typical software deployments. We will also see what it means to deploy, monitor accuracies and even rollback models & custom scorers as well as how API based techniques enable consuming business processes and applications to remain relatively stable amidst all the chaos

Data scientists and engineers are often expected to learn, develop and maintain the infrastructure for their experiments. This process takes time away from focussing on training and developing the models.

What if there was a way of abstracting away the non Machine Learning related tasks while still retaining control? This talk will discuss the merits of using Kubeflow. Kubeflow is an open source Kubernetes based platform. With the help of Kubeflow, users can:
- Develop Machine Learning models easily and make repeatable, portable deployments on a diverse infrastructure e.g. laptop to production cluster.
- Scale infrastructure based on the demand.

This talk will also present the current use cases of Kubeflow and how teams from other industries have been utilising the cloud to scale their machine learning operations.

Kubernetizing Big Data and ML Workloads at Uber - Mayank Bansal & Min Cai, Uber  

Uber relies on Big Data and ML to make business critical decisions such as pricing, trip ETA, etc. Today, those workloads such as Hive and Spark are running on YARN. To save millions of dollars by efficient use of cluster resources, Uber is planning to use Kubernetes to co-locate BigData/ML and micro-service workloads.  Kubernetes is the de-facto standard for running micro-services. However, in comparison to YARN, it still lacks many features like hierarchical resource pools, elastic resource sharing, gang scheduling etc. To bridge this gap, we have re-architected Peloton to be a set of Kubernetes scheduler and controller plugins so that we can provide feature parity with YARN.  This talk will cover: - Learnings of running large-scale BigData/ML on Kubernetes with Peloton - Colocation of mixed workloads - Federation across zones - Feature and API parity with YARN

Description

Data cleaning is the first step of every Data Science project. Next one does Data Science. The talk covers a missing step of deployment and scaling Data Applications in production. We will go through all major steps of the process like Dockerizing application, Continuous Deployment with further AWS stack creation and rolling deploys although also covering new trends in Serverless architecture.

Abstract

Data Science is quite a young field. One of the definitions of Data Scientist: Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician. Hence, it's quite important to talk not only about best practices of feature generation and not overfitting but also about more of software engineering topics.

The talk is based on our experience of Data Science developments at Stylight, an international fashion e-commerce company, that operates in 15 countries worldwide. We refer to our Data Applications written in R and Python, Scala; but the content is not limited to mentioned languages and applicable others.

The talk consists three main parts. A first part introduces best practices of development. How to structure your development, make deployment easy and reproducible, how to make Continuous Integration and commit triggered deployments. The second part covers production deployment to AWS stack, in particular focusing on concepts of immutable infrastructure and infrastructure as code. The last part about using serverless architecture for data applications. We introduce an example of our outlier detection system, that automatically scales based on such approach. 00:00 Welcome!

I will do this talk from my experience on the exploration and production Hadoop environment as a senior Ops engineer. For this we are using OpenShift to run Docker containers that connect to the big data Hadoop environment.

During this talk I will explain why we need this and how this is done at ING. Also how to set up a docker container running a data science model using Hive, Python, and Spark. I’ll explain how to use Docker files to build Docker images, add all the needed components inside the Docker image, and how to run different versions of software in different containers.

In the end I will also give a demo of how it runs and is automated using Git with webhook connecting to Jenkins and start the docker service that will connect to a big data Hadoop environment.

This is going to be a great technical talk for engineers and data scientist.",751,10,0,0,"Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Docker / Container",N/A

DUPNgMRV1-I,Introducing Kubeflow (w. Special Guests Tensorflow and Apache Spark),2019-04-18T21:34:07Z,UC5o4P1O-WVE15EZWqayc5dw,"Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence has exploded in popularity in the last five years, but the nagging question remains, “How to put models into production?” Engineers are typically tasked to build one-off systems to serve predictions which must be maintained amid a quickly evolving back-end serving space which has evolved from single-machine, to custom clusters, to “serverless”, to Docker, to Kubernetes. In this talk, we present KubeFlow- an open source project which makes it easy for users to move models from laptop to ML Rig to training cluster to deployment. In this talk we will discuss, “What is KubeFlow?”, “why scalability is so critical for training and model deployment?”, and other topics.

Users can deploy models written in Python’s skearn, R, Tensorflow, Spark, and many more. The magic of Kubernetes allows data scientists to write models on their laptop, deploy to an ML-Rig, and then devOps can move that model into production with all of the bells and whistles such as monitoring, A/B tests, multi-arm bandits, and security.",1287,12,0,0,"dataworks summit barcelona, dws19, kubeflow, tensorflow, apache spark, holden karau",N/A

Building Cross-Cloud ML Pipelines with Kubeflow with Spark & Tensorflow - Holden Karau, Google & Trevor Grant, IBM 

Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence has exploded in popularity in the last five years, but the nagging question remains, “How to put models into production?” In this talk, we present KubeFlow- an open source project aims to answer this.    This talk will examine how the intricacies involved in taking your pipeline and running it between clouds, mixing data from multiple sources, and building multi-component pipelines. We’ll examine how to tie together multiple tools to prepare your data and train the final model, as well as how to create a serving system to match.    The audience will learn how to use kubernetes as a replacement for YARN simplifying your big data stack and empowering your data scientists to self-serve libraries and avoid being responsible for maintaining 20 different incompatible conda environments.
