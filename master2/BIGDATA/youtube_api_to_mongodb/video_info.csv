BaT5DXDIGVI,Frontiers in Machine Learning: Accelerating Machine Learning with Confidential Computing,2020-07-28T20:00:14Z,UCCb9_Kn8F_Opb3UCGm-lILQ,"In the recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has facilitated key applications, such as medical imaging, video analytics, and financial forecasting. Understanding the massive computing requirements of ML, cloud providers have been investing in accelerated ML computing and a range of ML services. A key concern in such systems, however, is the privacy of the sensitive data being analyzed and the confidentiality of the trained models. Confidential cloud computing provides a vehicle for privacy-preserving ML, enabling multiple entities to collaborate and train accurate models using sensitive data, and to serve these models with assurance that their data and models remain protected, even from privileged attackers. In this session, our speakers will demonstrate applications and advancements in Confidential ML: (i) how confidential computing hardware can accelerate multi-party and collaborative training, creating an incentive for data sharing; and (ii) how emerging cloud accelerator systems can be re-designed to deliver strong privacy guarantees, overcoming the limited performance of CPU-based confidential computing.

----------------------------------------
# Abstract:

The rise of real-time data processing has transformed business operations, yet navigating its technical challenges remains complex. Organizations often wrestle with managing distinct batch and streaming data workflows, each presenting unique difficulties. Batch processing, while effective for large datasets, can be costly, slow, and not well-suited for streaming API integration. On the other hand, streaming, despite its speed and low latency, often has restricted functionality.

This talk is prepared for developers, data engineers, and tech visionaries eager to explore how to build an efficient, dynamic, and unified data pipeline for both scenarios using streaming platforms in Python. You will see with examples how simple it is to make your batch code run in streaming with serverless infrastructure from day 1.

Excerpt from OReilly's Book on MLOps.
 
"" ML Ops originated as a derivative of applying DevOps practices to data science and machine learning workflows or pipelines. The term combines ML (machine learning) and operations (Ops). At its core, it represents a repeatable process to deploy, monitor, and maintain these pipelines in operational or production systems. 

Companies that build this kind of methodical thinking into their data science have a big competitive advantage over those that consistently fail to operationalize models and that fail to prioritize action over mere insight ""

Intro/Outro Music: Thanks to Gerhard Herselman for supplying the music for us to use. 

At Nomanini we built our first payments platform on Google Cloud when it was still only App Engine. As our product grew we built an ever-more-complex monolith. As our start-up pivoted we needed more flexibility, and wanted to experiment with newer technologies. With only three developers we made the bold decision to migrate our platform from an App Engine monolith to microservices running on Docker and Kubernetes. In this frank discussion I talk about the reasons why we made this move, the pitfalls we experienced, the benefits of the move, and why we love Kubernetes on Google Cloud.

Dale Humby
I'm passionate about product development and the various agile methodologies that enables a team to perform at its peak. I'm a co-founder of Nomanini, a payments platform that allows informal merchants across Africa to provide essential services like airtime, electricity and banking services to rural communities.

A few of the issues end users may face include memory and scalability limitations of these tools and the exorbitant costs associated with transferring large amounts of data between different platforms. 

In this session, we will introduce Procedural Language R (PL/R) as a closer integration of R with the Greenplum Database, an open source massively parallel processing (MPP) engine for big data analytics. While the focus of this talk will be on PL/R, the same principles described in the session are applicable to all languages supported by the Procedural Language extension framework (e.g. R, Python, Java, C, Perl) of the Greenplum Database.

We will describe how to get started on PL/R, and walk through code examples from case studies in industries such as retail, telco and utilities that illustrate the flexibility and performance of this framework. Further, we will touch on how tools such as PL/R can be leveraged for scalable statistical and machine learning algorithm development on big data platforms using Bayesian Hierarchical Regression with Gibbs Sampling as an illustrative example.

// Intro to Kubeflow
As the involvement of Machine Learning components in software products is increasing rapidly, there is a growing need for tools to operate and orchestrate Machine Learning development and deployment. One of those tools is Kubeflow. Developed by Google for the Open Source community, this tool aims to organize the cycle of model development, testing, and deployment on the infrastructure of Kubernetes. In this talk, we will introduce the tool, its capabilities, and its integration in the infrastructure of organizations.

// Simplifying and extending Kubeflow with serverless ML functions

Serverless can simplify data science by automating the process of code to container and enables users to add instrumentation and auto-scaling with minimum overhead. However, serverless has many limitations involving performance, lack of concurrency, lack of GPU support, limited application patterns and limited debugging possibilities. Yaron Haviv will introduce Kubeflow, and how it works with Nuclio and MLRun, open source projects enabling serverless data-science and full ML lifecycle automation over Kubeflow.

Yaron will show real-world examples and a demo and explain how it can significantly accelerate projects time to market and save resources.",291,4,0,1,,N/A

More videos at https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com

Summary
- For web deployment, you need to be familiar with the concept of REST API.
- You can deploy the code to Virtual Machines, and then scale by adding instances.
- You can deploy the code as containers, and then scale via orchestration.
- You can deploy the code as a “server-less function.”
- You can deploy the code via a model serving solution.
- If you are making CPU inference, you can get away with scaling by launching more servers (Docker), or going serverless (AWS Lambda).
- If you are using GPU inference, things like TF Serving and Clipper become useful with features such as adaptive batching.",2682,16,0,1,"machine learning, deep learning",en

The major goals of our research platform are to enable high-throughput scheduling of jobs, use open source software and to provide queueing capabilities once the number of jobs exceeds capacity.  We use Openstack for our hardware provisioning.  However, provisioning hardware is only the first step in building a research platform.  In this talk we will discuss how you can build a research platform on top of OpenStack and Kubernetes to better enable quantitative researchers to run their workflows.  The types of workflows we have to support range from analytics to machine learning.   

Armada is an open source project developed at G-Research.  Armada enables researchers to submit thousands of jobs to a multi cluster Kubernetes compute platform and these jobs get prioritized.

- **What is a container?**: You can Abstract containers as lightweight virtual machines with their own CPU, Memory and Network Resources
- software that packages up code and all its dependencies
- so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
- **Docker Image:** To start a container you need a docker image, this image is your blueprint for the container, you can get prebuilt images like MySQ
- **Dockerfile:** A yaml based instructions for building the image. You can consider it like DNA to the image with all the set of instructions in a place to make the image.

YAg6H92tpQc,Dask + Kubernetes | Advanced Data Transformation Pipeline | Dask Summit 2021,2021-06-22T22:39:11Z,UCj9eavqmvwaCyKhIlu2GaoA,"Speakers - Michael Sebbah, Noureddine Boumlaik, Philippe Cotte

AI algorithms for financial portfolio management require distributed computation based on complex worklows. We are happy to share with you how we transform many financial data based on Dask to reach this goal. Dask distributed on Kubernetes is a simple but powerful solution for that. Furthermore we will present a thin wrapper on top of Dask futures to allow lazy and partial computations.
