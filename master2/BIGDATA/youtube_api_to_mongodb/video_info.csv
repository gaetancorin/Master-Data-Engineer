Though machine learning and AI are immensely powerful, these solutions are by no means easy. In many cases, there are many diverse components that are not designed to work together. Additionally, these models are most efficient when running on large scale clusters that can be more difficult to manage. Configuration and deployment is often left to data scientists who are wasting time on infrastructure and not on data science itself.Kubernetes to the rescue! In this session I will talk about how machine learning can be greatly improved by implementing ML solutions on top of Kubernetes with containers. I will be discussing each stage of a typical workflow including: data preparation/versioning, model training, testing and validation, monitoring, and CI/CD and automation. Demos will include tooling such as Tensorflow/Kubeflow, Pachyderm, Argo, etc.This talk is for both data scientists and infrastructure/SRE teams alike helping bring the benefits of DevOps to AI and machine learning.",1818,34,0,N/A,,N/A

Presented at All Things Open 2020 - Big Data Track

Abstract: Docker has become a standard tool for developers around the world to deploy applications in a reproducible and robust manner. The existence of Docker and Docker compose have reduced the time needed to set up new software and implementing complex technology stacks for our applications.

Now, six years after the initial release of Docker, we can say with confidence that containers and containers orchestration have become some of the defaults in the current technology stacks.

There are thousands of tutorials and getting started documents for those wanting to adopt Docker for apps deployment. However, if you are a Data Scientist, a researcher or someone working on scientific computing wanting to adopt Docker, the story is quite different. There are very few tutorials (in comparison to app/web) and documents focused on Docker best practices for DS and scientific computing. If you are working on DS, ML or scientific computing, this talk is for you. We'll cover best practices when building Docker containers for data-intensive applications, from optimising your image build, to ensuring your containers are secure and efficient deployment workflows. We will talk about the most common problems faced while using Docker with data-intensive applications and how you can overcome most of them. Finally, I'll give some practical and useful tips for you to improve your Docker workflows and practises.

Attendees will leave the talk feeling confident about adopting Docker across a range of DS, ML and research projects.",55,N/A,0,0,"all things open, open source, ato2020, technology, Big Data, Tania Allard PhD, Microsoft, docker, Data Scientist",N/A

How to Use Kubernetes to Build a Data Lake for AI Workloads - Peter MacKinnon & Uday Boppana, Red Hat 

The recent popularity of hybrid cloud architectures have left organizations with traditional data lakes behind. How do you build a data architecture that is cloud provider agnostic and is flexible enough to run in across public and private cloud data centers? How do you make this data available to data scientists and developers in a way that simplifies the creation of intelligent applications?  This talk will walk through a new way of building data lakes for the hybrid cloud using Rook and Ceph community projects running on Kubernetes. With a single data architecture deployment that can run in any cloud or across multiple clouds, IT and data engineers can use open source tools on Kubernetes such as Rook, Ceph, Hive metastore, Spark, and Presto to provide unified access to massive amounts of data across multiple data centers for data scientists and developers.

Managing Machine Learning in Production with Kubeflow and DevOps - David Aronchick, Microsoft  

Kubeflow has helped bring machine learning to Kubernetes, but there’s still a significant gap relative to how to productize these workloads. While DevOps and GitOps have made huge traction in recent years, many customers struggle to apply these practices to ML workloads. 

This talk will focus on ways to effectively infuse AI into production-grade applications through establishing practices around model reproducibility, validation, versioning/tracking, and safe/compliant deployment. 

We will demonstrate how to run an E2E machine learning system using nothing more than Git. This will integrate DevOps, data and ML pipelines together, and show how to use multiple workload orchestrators together. 

While the examples will be run using Azure Pipelines and Kubeflow, we will also show how to extend these platforms to any orchestration tool.

wytCjR-qdpI,Infrastructure Agnostic Machine Learning Workload Deployment,2021-07-12T17:48:04Z,UC3q8O3Bh2Le8Rj1-Q-_UUbA,"When it comes to Large Scale data processing and Machine Learning, Apache Spark is no doubt one of the top battle-tested frameworks out there for handling batched or streaming workloads.  The ease of use, built-in Machine Learning modules, and multi-language support makes it a very attractive choice for data wonks. However bootstrapping and getting off the ground could be difficult for most teams without leveraging a Spark cluster that is already pre-provisioned and provided as a managed service in the Cloud, while this is a very attractive choice to get going, in the long run, it could be a very expensive option if it’s not well managed.

As an alternative to this approach, our team has been exploring and working a lot with running Spark and all our Machine Learning workloads and pipelines as containerized Docker packages on Kubernetes. This provides an infrastructure-agnostic abstraction layer for us, and as a result, it improves our operational efficiency and reduces our overall compute cost. Most importantly, we can easily target our Spark workload deployment to run on any major Cloud or On-prem infrastructure (with Kubernetes as the common denominator)  by just modifying a few configurations.

In this talk, we will walk you through the process our team follows to make it easy for us to run a production deployment of our Machine Learning workloads and pipelines on Kubernetes which seamlessly allows us to port our implementation from a local Kubernetes set up on the laptop during development to either an On-prem or Cloud Kubernetes environment.

iuWL2acLvP4,Scaling Machine Learning Pipelines in Cloud - Salman Iqbal - NDC Oslo 2021,2022-03-02T12:47:11Z,UCTdw38Cw6jcm0atBPA39a0Q,"One of the most common hurdles with developing data science/machine learning models is to design end-to-end pipelines that can operate at scale and in real-time. Data scientists and engineers are often expected to learn, develop and maintain the infrastructure for their experiments. This process takes time away from focussing on training and developing the models.

What if there was a way of abstracting away the non Machine Learning related tasks while still retaining control? This talk will discuss the merits of using Kubeflow. Kubeflow is an open source Kubernetes based platform. With the help of Kubeflow, users can:
- Develop Machine Learning models easily and make repeatable, portable deployments on a diverse infrastructure e.g. laptop to production cluster.
- Scale infrastructure based on the demand.

This talk will also present the current use cases of Kubeflow and how teams from other industries have been utilising the cloud to scale their machine learning operations.

Non optimal practices, the people-heavy way of the traditional approaches, the developers love for complex solutions for the sake of using cool technologies makes the situation even worse.

There are two key ingredients required to streamline this: “the cloud” and “the right level of devops abstractions”.

In this talk, I’ll share the experiences of building a cloud-based platform for streamlining data science and how such solutions can greatly simplify building and deploying data science and machine learning applications.

We present the evolution of a model to a production API that can scale to large e-commerce needs. On the journey we discuss metrics of success and how to use the Kubernetes cluster manager and associated tools for deploy. In addition to the use of these tools we highlight how to make use of the cluster management system for further testing and experimentation with your models.

The chasm between data science and dev ops is often wide and impenetrable, but the two fields have more in common than meets the eye. Every data scientist will be able to lean in and help their career by investing in a basic understanding the basic principles of dev ops. In this talk I present the notions of service level indicators, objectives, and agreements. I cover the rigorous monitoring and testing of services. Finally we demonstrate how to build a basic data science workflow and push to production level APIs with Docker and Kubernetes.

Kubernetes is an opinionated container cluster manager with an easy to use, robust interface. It can be use on very small and very large clusters. Docker is a container system that allows one to build code in an isolated environment. Paired with a container manager such as Kubernetes we are able to manage millions of instances as needed for a production deployment. These tools are two of many different options but are considered among the best open source solutions available. 00:00 Welcome!

A major financial institute supports its analytic workload via docker containers with access to R, Python, and SAS. This talk discusses how we built and deployed containers with the open source tools needed for their Data Scientists to complete their work. It discusses how containers enable their IT department to meet the ad hoc, compute intensive, and scaling demands of the organization. It also covers how provisioning thin clients via Jupyter Notebooks, R Studio, and SAS Studio, empowers Data Scientists with the tool of their choice. An exciting differentiator for the Data Scientist, is the ability to send a portion of the analytic workload to run inside their Hadoop cluster. Lastly, we discuss extending the container by pushing the analytic workload to run inside the Hadoop cluster; thus enabling the Data Scientists to dive inside the data lake and harness the power of all the data.

Several cases involve a combination of domain specific models such as physics based models, probabilistic models and AI/ML models. In many cases, each of these models could be written in a different programming language and/or with several different libraries within the same programming language. This necessitates the need for containerized and orchestrated workloads. In some cases, different parts of the pipeline could be owned by different groups that may not want to expose the IP. 
In addition, model calibration and optimization use cases require more than a simple DAG orchestration. In many of these cases, cyclic and conditional workflows are needed.  When dealing with Industrial IoT applications, hundreds if not thousands of models are normally built to represent a single asset. In addition, optimization and calibration use cases require executing the pipelines thousands of times for each optimization or calibration exercise. Hence scaling such complex pipelines is a key component of industrial analytics systems. We will showcase building and managing such complex pipelines using various GCP services such as GKE, TFX, PubSub and BigTable.

Kubernetizing Big Data and ML Workloads at Uber - Mayank Bansal & Min Cai, Uber  

Uber relies on Big Data and ML to make business critical decisions such as pricing, trip ETA, etc. Today, those workloads such as Hive and Spark are running on YARN. To save millions of dollars by efficient use of cluster resources, Uber is planning to use Kubernetes to co-locate BigData/ML and micro-service workloads.  Kubernetes is the de-facto standard for running micro-services. However, in comparison to YARN, it still lacks many features like hierarchical resource pools, elastic resource sharing, gang scheduling etc. To bridge this gap, we have re-architected Peloton to be a set of Kubernetes scheduler and controller plugins so that we can provide feature parity with YARN.  This talk will cover: - Learnings of running large-scale BigData/ML on Kubernetes with Peloton - Colocation of mixed workloads - Federation across zones - Feature and API parity with YARN

At its core, YARN has a very powerful scheduler which enforces global cluster level invariants and helps sites manage user and operator expectations of elastic sharing, resource usage limits, SLAs, and more. YARN recently increased its support for Docker containerization and added a YARN service framework supporting long-running services.

In this session we will explore the emerging patterns and challenges related to containers and big data workloads, including running applications such as Apache Spark, Apache HBase, and Kubernetes in containers on YARN.

B3hfAZmxCrU,Deploying Machine Learning models on Kubernetes,2022-03-23T17:57:58Z,UCkm6luGCS3hD25jcEhvRMIA,"What is the event about? 
Until recently, the Data Science and Machine Learning (ML) field has been under utilised in its adoption of DevOps tools and processes However that's now changing, as engineering teams gain any value from their Machine learning models, by  get them into production. In this talk, Ed will introduce the open source Seldon Core library, build a model using popular machine learning tools and deploy it to Kubernetes to handle production traffic.  You will learn how to turn an ML model into a production microservice that handles REST (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface)/gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) traffic, how to use complex model deployment techniques and how to monitor both the infrastructure and the models themselves, spotting drift and outliers as they take place.

Who is it aimed at:
Data Scientists, DevOps Engineers or ML Engineers

Why should you attend?
Getting ML models into production is the hardest and most in-demand skill in machine learning right now. This talk teaches you how to do that.

Speaker Bio:
Ed Shee, Head of Developer Relations at Seldon

In this session, you will learn key components such as ""Training platform"", ""Validation platform"" and ""Serving platform"", and how to combine them to build an end-to-end platform for the continuous deployment. As a concrete example, we will demonstrate an example architecture consisted of multiple GCP services to explain how data freshness affects your ML models, and why the continuous deployment is critical to keep the quality of your ML models.

Ben Hamner - CTO of Kaggle 

One of the biggest pain points in data science today is that a data scientist's work isn't reproducible. This makes it hard for a data scientist to come back to their own work 6 months down the road, and even harder for a colleague to leverage the analytics that have already been done. Docker containers enable a simple solution to this. 

At Kaggle, we're maintaining kaggle/python, kaggle/rstats, and kaggle/julia public docker containers designed to make it easy for data scientists to get started on a new analytics task & to build off work that they or others have already done. In this talk, I'll cover how we're using docker at Kaggle for reproducible data science, how our community's found it valuable, and how you can leverage this in your own workflows.",2846,41,0,3,"containers, containerization, data science, kaggle, docker, container camp, ben hamner",N/A
