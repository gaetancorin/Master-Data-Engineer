major word processing applications is broadly similar However during the era when school assignments were done in                                 |\n|handwriting or with typewriters the rules for these definitions often differed from todays consensus                                                      |\n|Most importantly many students were drilled on the rule that certain words don't count

                        |\n|compounds such as follow up noun or long term adjective were counted as one word To save the time and effort of counting                                  |\n|word by word often a rule of thumb for the average number of words per line was used such as 10 words per line These rules                                |\n|have fallen by the wayside in the word processing era the word count feature of such software which follows the text                                      |\n|segmentation rules mentioned earlier is now the standard arbiter because it is largely
